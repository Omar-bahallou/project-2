## Deployment

  <summary>How do I get the contact form to work?</summary>
  
  To get the contact form working create an AWS account and set up SES (Simple Email service). Then plug in your details into `.dev.vars.example` and rename it to `.dev.vars`. You'll also need to add these as enviroment variables in the Cloudflare dashboard for it to work in production. Or if you don't mind sending through gmail use [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) instead.
